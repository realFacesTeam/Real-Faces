## Heading ##
  > The 3D video chat website.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A 3D virtual reality application, where the characters have their user's actual face, streamed in real time.

## Summary ##
  > Real Talk aims to bridge the gap between the virtual and the real by allowing users to communicate in an online 3D world, whilst being able to share voice and facial expressions through real time video and audio connections. For the first time ever you can communicate through sound, sight and space!

## Problem ##
  > Ever found that group video conferences lack some of the body language cues used in real life? Have they had awkward pauses when people are unsure of whose turn it is to speak, or multiple people beginning to talk at the same time? Have you ever wished that there was an easier way for online groups, such as remote students, to get to know each other and have informal chats? By making bringing video conferences closer to real life communication, Real Talk helps to solve these problems. 

## Solution ##
  > Real Talk helps to fix video conferencing's current lack of body language communication by providing avatars that allow for a greater range of expression. The direction an avatar is facing and and the direction of the eyes give indications of who the person is listening to and whose "turn" it is to talk. Proximity, position and gesture allow for a far fuller collection of non-verbal messages. Informal chats are far more natural as participants can move through a room, joining and leaving conversations in a manner similar to real life.
